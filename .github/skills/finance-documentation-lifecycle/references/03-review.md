# Phase 3: Review – Check

**Goal**: Verify accuracy, completeness, clarity, and compliance *before* approval. Identify gaps and nonconformities early.

**ISO 9001 alignment**: Clause 7.5.2 requires review and approval "for suitability and adequacy" before release. Early review prevents misuse and rework.

## Steps

### 1. Technical Accuracy Review

**Who**: Subject matter expert, process owner, or system administrator

**Check**:
- Do procedures match how the process actually works today?
- Are system screenshots current (screens change after upgrades)?
- Are calculations correct? (formulas, thresholds, tolerances)
- Are role names and titles current?
- Are account numbers, GL codes, reporting line names correct?
- Have recent policy or regulatory changes been incorporated?
- Are references to external documents (SOX requirements, audit standards) accurate?

**How to identify gaps**:
- Walk through the documented procedure step-by-step; does it match reality?
- Have the process owner execute the procedure using only the documentation—do they get stuck?
- Ask: "If someone new joined the team and read only this document, could they do this task?"

**Document findings**:
- List accuracy issues, missing steps, outdated references
- Note severity: critical (process breaks), major (user confused), minor (clarification needed)
- Log as nonconformity if gaps could cause errors or control weaknesses (e.g., "Missing approval step in high-risk control")

### 2. Completeness and Clarity Review

**Who**: Finance manager, process owner, target user (new hire or auditor)

**Check**:
- Are all required steps included?
- Are decision points clear? (if X, do Y; if not X, do Z)
- Are roles and responsibilities explicit?
- Are examples provided for complex procedures?
- Is the language plain? (can a non-expert understand it?)
- Are appendices and templates complete?
- Are assumptions stated? (e.g., "assumes daily bank feed is available")
- Are escalation paths clear? (what happens if variance exceeds limit?)

**How to identify gaps**:
- Ask first-time users: "What would you do if [edge case happens]?"
- Trace a procedure from start to finish—are there unexplained transitions?
- Compare the documented procedure to the actual process flow—does it match?

**Document findings**:
- Note missing steps, unclear language, incomplete examples
- Severity: critical (procedure cannot be executed), major (user likely confused), minor (could be clearer)

---

### 3. Control Design and Compliance Review

**Who**: Compliance/audit team, internal control specialist, CFO

**Check**:
- Does this procedure mitigate the intended risk?
- Is the control frequency appropriate for the risk level?
- Is the control performer independent (segregation of duties)?
- Is there sufficient evidence (audit trail, approvals, logs) that the control operated?
- Does the procedure meet regulatory or standard requirements?
- Are variances escalated appropriately?
- Is there a clear nonconformity reporting process?

**How to identify gaps**:
- Compare the procedure to the control design matrix or risk register
- Ask audit: "Does this procedure provide sufficient evidence?"
- Check compliance checklist: COSO, SOX, AICPA, industry standards

**Document findings**:
- Note control gaps, segregation of duties issues, audit trail weaknesses
- Severity: critical (control ineffective), major (audit exposure), minor (advisory improvement)

---

### 4. Compile Review Findings

**Review summary**:
- List all findings by category (accuracy, completeness, clarity, control, compliance)
- Assign severity (critical, major, minor)
- Identify who needs to take action (document owner, process owner, manager)

**Example**:
```
REVIEW FINDINGS
─────────────────────────────────────────
ACCURACY
- Step 3: System screenshot outdated (prior to Jan 2025 system upgrade). CRITICAL.
- Step 7: GL code changed from 5100 to 5110 per 2024 COA update. CRITICAL.

CLARITY
- Step 5 unclear: "Reconcile variance" but doesn't say how or what tolerance. MAJOR.
- No example provided for edge case (when two vendors have same invoice number). MAJOR.

CONTROL DESIGN
- Manager approval missing for variances >$5,000. CRITICAL.

COMPLIANCE
- No reference to SOX requirement for monthly close sign-off. MAJOR.
─────────────────────────────────────────
```

### 5. Schedule Review Meeting (For High-Risk or Complex Documentation)

**Attendees**:
- Document owner
- Process owner
- Finance manager
- Compliance/audit rep (if high-risk)
- Key users (1–2 people who execute the procedure daily)

**Agenda**:
- Walk through findings (accuracy, completeness, clarity, control, compliance)
- Discuss severity and priority for fixes
- Assign responsibility and timeline for remediation
- Decide: approve as-is, approve with notes, request revisions, reject for major rework

**Document outcomes**:
- Meeting minutes (who attended, what was discussed, decisions made)
- Revised task list (what needs fixing, owner, timeline)

---

### 6. Request Revisions or Approve with Feedback

**Revisions needed** (critical and major findings):
- Return to document owner with specific feedback
- Provide timeline for revision (usually 1–2 weeks)
- Document what feedback was given and why

**Minor feedback**:
- Can often be noted and addressed in next review cycle
- Or approve with annotated feedback for owner to incorporate

- [ ] Readable format (headings, white space, numbered steps)
- [ ] Assumptions stated
- [ ] Cross-references to related documents

**Control and Compliance**:
- [ ] Control design sound (objective, frequency, evidence, segregation of duties)
- [ ] Regulatory/standard requirements met
- [ ] Variance escalation process clear

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why It Matters | How to Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| Skipping technical review | Procedure doesn't match reality; users frustrated; control fails | Have process owner walk through with documentation only |
| No compliance review | Audit finds gaps; control fails SOX or other requirement | Engage compliance/audit early; use control matrix as checklist |
| Unclear findings | Owner doesn't know what to fix; documentation fails to improve | Use specific examples; link findings to user impact or control risk |
| No review meeting (small docs) | Owner unsure about priority; misses key feedback; document still wrong | Document summary of findings in writing; prioritize critical + major items |
| User not in review | Approved document still confuses users; not used as intended | Include 1–2 actual users in review; ask them to try the procedure |
